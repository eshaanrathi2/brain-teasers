## Observations:
- Don’t submit the code. It can’t be modified after subitting. Auto-save feature = Yes.
- Correctness matters. Create custom test cases and test the code heavily.
- Time and Space complexity matter. Make sure code is optimal.
- Don’t Don’t Don’t forget about empty i/p. That is 20% of the points.
- Don’t forget about boundary conditions, large i/p, random i/p.
